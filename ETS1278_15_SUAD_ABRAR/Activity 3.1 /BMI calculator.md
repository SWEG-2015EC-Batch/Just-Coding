Step 1: Start

 2: Initialize variables weight, height, BMI as float and gender as char

 3: Start a loop to repeat the process

 4: Prompt the user to enter weight

 5: Read weight

 6: Prompt the user to enter height

 7: Read height

 8: Prompt the user to enter gender

 9: Read gender

 10: Calculate BMI as weight / (height * height)

 11: Print "Body Mass Index(BMI) of user is " followed by the value of BMI and gender

 12: Check the conditions for different BMI ranges and gender

 13: If BMI > 30, print "obesity"

 14: If gender is 'F' and BMI < 18.5, print "under weight"

 15: If gender is 'F' and BMI >= 18.5 and BMI < 24, print "normal weight"

 16: If gender is 'F' and BMI >= 24 and BMI < 30, print "over weight"

 17: If gender is 'M' and BMI < 20.5, print "under weight"

 18: If gender is 'M' and BMI >= 20.5 and BMI < 25, print "normal weight"

 19: If gender is 'M' and BMI >= 25 and BMI < 30, print "over weight"

 20: If none of the above conditions match, print "obesity"

 21: End

 6: If Test result is invalid, print "Invalid Mark" and prompt the user to enter a valid mark

 7: Repeat steps 3-6 for Quiz, Project, Assignment, and Final results

 8: Calculate Total as the sum of Test, Quiz, Project, Assignment, and Final

 10: If Total is greater than or equal to 90, print "A+"

 11: If Total is greater than or equal to 80, print "A"

 12: If Total is greater than or equal to 75, print "B+"

 13: If Total is greater than or equal to 60, print "B"

 14: If Total is greater than or equal to 55, print "C+"

 15: If Total is greater than or equal to 45, print "C"

 16: If Total is greater than or equal to 30, print "D"

 17: If Total is less than 30, print "F"

 18: Print Total

 19: End

Step 1. Start
2. Initialize variables 'choice', 'Chara', 'n', 'm', 'width', and 'length'
3. Display the menu options for pattern selection
4. Prompt the user to enter their choice and store it in 'choice'
5. Start a switch statement based on 'choice'
6. For each case:
   - Case 'A' or 'a':
     - Prompt the user to enter the initial number, final number, width, and length
     - Use a nested loop to print numbers in a rectangular pattern based on the given inputs
   - Case 'B' or 'b':
     - Prompt the user to enter the length and width of the pattern
     - Use nested loops to print stars in a rectangular pattern based on the given inputs
   - Case 'C' or 'c':
     - Prompt the user to enter the number of rows and columns
     - Use nested loops to print a hollow rectangular star pattern based on the given inputs
   - ... (Repeat the process for each pattern)
7. End the switch statement
8. End the program
9. End

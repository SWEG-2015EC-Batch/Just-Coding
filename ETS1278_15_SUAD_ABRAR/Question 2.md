1) Problem analysis
   
   1.1) Input: mileage, capacity (in gallons) 
   
   1.2) output: length (in miles)
   
   1.3) process
   - Variable declaration 
   - Read the input data
   - Calculate length (in miles)=mineage*capacity of the fuel tank (in gallons)
   - Print output and process result (length) in miles
2) Design the program
   
   2.1) Variable declaration (what and how): float mileage, capacity
   
   2.2) Reading input data (how?)
   - cout<<"please enter mileage";
   - cin>>mileage;
   - cout<<"please enter the capacity of the fuel tank (in gallons)";
   - cin>>capacity;
     
   2.3) Perform operation- finding the length (in miles)(how?)
   
    length (in miles)=mineage*capacity (in gallons)

   2.4) print result(in miles) (how?)
   
    cout<<"The miles the automobile can be driven without refueling is "<<mineage*capacity<<endl;

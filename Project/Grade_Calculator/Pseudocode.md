Step 1. Start

Step 2. Display a welcome message.

Step 3. Set the precision for floating-point output to 2.

Step 3. Prompt the user to enter the number of courses.

Step 4. Check if the number of courses exceeds the maximum limit. If it does, display an error message and end the program.

Step 5. Create arrays to store the names of the courses and their credit hours.

Step 6. Prompt the user to enter the name and credit hours for each course, and store them in the respective arrays.

Step 7. Prompt the user to enter the number of students.

Step 8. Check if the number of students exceeds the maximum limit. If it does, display an error message and end the program.

Step 9. Create arrays to store the student IDs, CGPAs, and average marks.

Step 10. Prompt the user to enter the ID for each student, and store them in the studentIDs array.

Step 11. Use nested loops to iterate over each student and each course.

Step 12. Prompt the user to enter the total marks for each course for each student, and store them in the totalMarksForCourse array.

Step 13. Calculate the grade point for each course based on the total marks, and store the grade letter in the gradeLetter array.

Step 14. Calculate the total grade points and credit hours for each student.

Step 15. Calculate the average mark out of 100 for each student.

Step 16. Calculate the CGPA for each student.

Step 17. Display the CGPA, average mark, and grade letter for each student.

Step 18. Prompt the user to enter their choice (1 or 2) for additional functionality.
  
Step 19. Store the user's choice in a variable called hodOption.

Step 20. Use a switch statement to perform different actions based on the user's choice:

Step 21. (Switch)Case 1: Search for a specific student.

     - Prompt the user to enter the student ID to search for.
     
     - Iterate through the studentIDs array to find a matching student ID.
     
     - If a match is found, display the student's information (student ID, course names, total marks, grade letter, average marks, and CGPA).
     
     - If no match is found, display a message indicating that the student was not found.   
     
     Case 2: See top five ranked students.
     
     - Sort the students based on CGPA in descending order using a bubble sort algorithm.
     
     - Display the information of the top five ranked students (student ID, average marks, and CGPA).
     
   - Default: Display an error message indicating that an invalid option was chosen.
     
Step 22. End

step 1. start

2.prompt the user to enter any one character and stores it in the variable "ch"

3.use if-else statements to check the type of character entered:

If the character is a lowercase letter (between 'a' and 'z'), use the islower() and display "it is a lower case letter"

If the character is an uppercase letter (between 'A' and 'Z'), use the isupper()and display "it is an upper case letter"

If the character is a digit (between '0' and '9'), check if the character is even or odd by modulo (%). If the remainder is 0, display "it is an even number" else, display "it is an odd number"

If none of the above are true, assume it is a special character and display "it is a special character"

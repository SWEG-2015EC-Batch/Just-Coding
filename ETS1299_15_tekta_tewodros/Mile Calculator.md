Problem analysis

Input: mileage, capacity (in gallons)

Output: distance (in miles)

Process

Variable declaration

Read the input data

Calculate distance (in miles)=mineage*capacity of the fuel tank (in gallons)

Print output and process result (distance) in miles

Design the program

2.1) Variable declaration (what and how):

   Float mileage, capacity
2.2) Reading input data (how?) Cout<<”please enter mileage”;

   Cin>>mileage;

   Cout<<”please enter the capacity of the fuel tank (in gallons)”;

   Cin>>capacity;
2.3) Perform operation- finding the distance (in miles)(how?)

   Distance (in miles)=mineage*capacity (in gallons)
2.4) print result(in miles) (how?)

   Cout<<”The miles the automobile can be driven without refueling is “<<mineage*capacity<<endl;

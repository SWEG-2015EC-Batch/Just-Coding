- Write a program to calculate the miles a car can be driven before needing to refuel based on fuel tank capacity and mileage.

1. Problem Analysis

1.1 Inputs: Fuel tank capacity (gallons), mileage (miles per gallon) 

1.2 Output: miles 

1.3Process: Calculate miles = Fuel tank capacity * mileage

2. Program Design

- variable declaration for fuel tank capacity, mileage, miles 

- Print "Enter fuel tank capacity (gallons):" 

- Read user input for fuel tank capacity 

- Print "Enter mileage (mpg):"

- Read user input for mileage 

- Calculate miles = fuel tank capacity * mileage 

- Print output prompt message (" miles: ") and process result (miles).

- End

3. Algorithm

- Start 

- Prompt user to input fuel tank capacity 

- Read fuel tank capacity input

- Prompt user to input mileage

- Read mileage input

- Calculate miles = fuel tank capacity * mileage

- Print miles 

- End

Algorithm: Flowchart

graph LR;
id1([Start]);
id2[/Read capacity, mileage/];
id3(distance= capacity * mileage);
id4[/Print miles/];
id5([End]);
id1-->id2;
id2-->id3;
id3-->id4;
id4-->id5;

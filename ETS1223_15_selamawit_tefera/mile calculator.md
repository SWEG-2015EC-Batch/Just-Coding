- Write a program to calculate the miles a car can be driven before needing to refuel based on fuel tank capacity and mileage.

1. Problem Analysis

1.1 Inputs: Fuel tank capacity (gallons), mileage (miles per gallon) 

1.2 Output: Maximum miles 

1.3Process: Calculate maximum miles = Fuel tank capacity * mileage

2. Program Design

- variable declaration for fileSize, transmissionRate, transmissionTime variable 

- Input fileSize in MB 

- Convert fileSize to bytes 

- Set transmissionRate value

- Calculate transmissionTime = fileSize / transmissionRate 

- Print transTime result 

- End

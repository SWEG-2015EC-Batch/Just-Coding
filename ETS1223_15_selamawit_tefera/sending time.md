- Write a program to calculate the time required to transmit a file over a network based on file size and transmission rate.

1. Problem Analysis

1.1 Inputs: File size in MB

Transmission rate in characters per second

1.2 Output: Time required to transmit the file 

1.3 Process:

- Convert file size from MB to bytes by multiplying by 1024*1024

- Calculate transmission time = File size in bytes / Transmission rate

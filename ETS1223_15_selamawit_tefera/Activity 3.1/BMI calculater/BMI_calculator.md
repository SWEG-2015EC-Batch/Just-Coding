Step 1: Start

2: Initialize variables float weight, height, BMI and char gender

3: Start a loop to repeat the process

4: Prompt the user to enter weight

5: Read weight

6: Prompt the user to enter height

7: Read height

8: Prompt the user to enter gender

9: Read gender

10: Calculate BMI = weight / (height * height)

11: Print "Body Mass Index(BMI) of user is " followed by the value of BMI and gender

12: Check

    - If BMI > 30, print "obesity"
  
    - If gender is 'F' and BMI < 18.5, print "under weight"
  
    - If gender is 'F' and BMI >= 18.5 and BMI < 24, print "normal weight"
  
    - If gender is 'F' and BMI >= 24 and BMI < 30, print "over weight"
   
    - If gender is 'M' and BMI < 20.5, print "under weight"
   
    - If gender is 'M' and BMI >= 20.5 and BMI < 25, print "normal weight"
   
    - If gender is 'M' and BMI >= 25 and BMI < 30, print "over weight"
   
    - If none of the above conditions match, print "obesity"

13: End
